* Theme rules are similar to state rules in that they describe how modules
* or layouts might look. The theme styleshoeet can also contain components
* that are truely not reusable, but it should be used extremely sparingly in
* this regard. If you find that you have more than two or three components
* that fit into this category, you might want to reevaluate with the design
* and UI teams.
